# optstoic-gams
optStoic-minFlux/minRxn code for PMID: 26530953d

Requirement:
===========
1. GAMS
2. BARON solver
3. CPLEX solver


Description:
===========
1. optStoic 
- An MINLP-based optimization procedure for identifying the optimal stoichiometry of a reaction subject to thermodynamic constraints, charge and elemental balance. 

2. minFlux or minRxn
- An MILP procedure to identify pathway(s) that carry minimal flux or consist of minimal number of reaction that conform to the given reaction stoichiometry.
